## README

make sure it runs on the C drive as the program may not be able to establish the database due to 
```
basedir = os.path.ab.path(os.path.dirname(__file__))
```
however this could be due to college permissions stopping me
migrate.py can be copied into main.py where stated if the database file is not present

folders named:
	.idea
	__pycache__
	instance
	venv
were not created by me but by pycharm, i have decided to keep them for preservation's sake


to run the program run main.py
